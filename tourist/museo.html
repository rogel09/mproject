            <h2>Buabo Buabo</h2>
            <p>
              This was the source of drinking water during the Spanish regime to the first quarter American rule. At the beginnoing of the American regime, the government ordered the improvement of sanitation to control epidemics and required that the wells be covered with gravel and that one water pump was name "Artesiano". As a person was pumping his body had to bend and move up and down with his buttocks swaying back and forth. In ilocano this body motion is called "agbuabo-buabo". Passerby then from adjoining towns named the place and the pump together as "buabo-buabo". In the year 2009, to preserve this historical landmark, the Local Chief Executive envisioned that the Artesiano (Buabo-Buabo) be converted into a center for arts and Culture. This center aimed at generating historical and cultural awareness in the community as showcase the San Nicolenos artistry, originality, creativity and craftsmanship as far back as can be recorded, thus, giving visula form to San Nicolas history.
