            <h2>Balay San Nicolas</h2>
            <p>
                Balay San Nicolas was built in the early 1800s by Antonio Valdes, former gobernadorcillo. Locals recounted that it was also used during the American occupation and as headquarters of the Japanese Army in World War II. Declared as an “Important Cultural Property” in 2015, the structure, which was also called the Valdes-Lardizabal House, is a 19th century heritage house which, according to the National Museum, is the “oldest and most imposing heritage house in Ilocos Norte,” built in the traditional Spanish Colonial style.
