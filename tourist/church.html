            <h2>St. Nicholas De Tolentino Parish Church</h2>
            <p>
                San Nicolas Catholic Church is one of the oldest buildings in this province. The Augustinian Missionarries built a simple chapel of masonry, wood, bamboo and cagon in 1548 and as per report, the construction of the church began in 1701 but it was destroyed by earthquake. With improved enginnering techniques, brick technology devised, and kilns were put up in the town, the construction of the prsesent church began in 1811 and completed in 1830. The original structure of the church is one the must see places of the town because it speaks of the numerous people who kept the Catholic faith alive despite the turmoil of the past 400 years brought about by camilities that destroyed the church building. The church is named after the Saint Nicholas de Tolentino who was believed to have protected the people against the floods, earthquakes, fires, typhoons and other calamities.
