            <h2>Old Town Plaza</h2>
            <p>
                In 1948, Mayor Dumninador Madamba organized a popularity contest to raise fund for the construction of an auditorium and stage with the help of Architect Elias L. Ruiz who made the plan. Municipal President Cayetano Bonoan (1919-1921) solicited the statue of Dr. Jose Rizal from Mr. and Mrs. Gorgonio Reyes. The plaza thereafter served as the venue for social functions of the town. Without losing its original architectural structure and landscape, the present leadership introduced major improvements in the plaza where the stage is now adorned with bricks, goble tiles are laid down at the monument of Dr. Jose Rizal, the plaza was concreted and was elevated a bit, benches were provided and a rain-bridge was constructed making it a favorite quiescent place in the town.
